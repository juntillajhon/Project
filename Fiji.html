 </ul>
<H3> <B>The island nation of Fiji is an archipelago in the South Pacific that contains 
    approximately 300 islands and 540 islets scattered over about 1,000,000 square miles (3,000,000 square kilometres). Plan your Fiji vacation around sun-drenched beaches, turquoise lagoons and swaying palm trees. While Fiji might look similar to many other tropical getaways, 
    the country has something for every kind of nature enthusiast. 
    The islands offer quality waves, marine life and coral reefs for adventure 
    seekers such as surfers, divers and those who love snorkeling. Combine natural beauty 
    with ancient history at the Sigatoka Sand Dunes National Park, and go island hopping to 
    experience as many different individual islands and cultures as possible.</B></H3>
