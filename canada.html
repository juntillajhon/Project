<H3> Step into the world’s second-biggest country that is a unique mix of raw beauty and majestic 
    landscapes. Canada’s spectacular scenery ranges from serene lakes to lofty mountains, 
    the gorgeous Rocky mountain range, also home to polar bears and caribou, as well as glaciers 
    and fjords. One of the most beautiful countries in the world, Canada is also one of the coolest 
    one-stop destinations for family vacations and hikers. Come here to experience the surreal Aurora 
    Borealis, the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Canadian Rockies, Yukon territory’s great 
    wilderness, and B.C. mountain slopes that draw skiers and snowboarders. </H3>
